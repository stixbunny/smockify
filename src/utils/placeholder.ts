I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
Finally someone let me out of my cage
Now time for me is nothin', 'cause I'm countin' no age
Now I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible (ah y'all), bet you didn't think
So I command you to, panoramic view (you)
Look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kicking tunes?
Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional? Mystical? Maybe
Spiritual hero who appears on you to clear your view
When you're too crazy
Lifeless to those the definition for what life is
Priceless to you because I put you on the hype shift
Did you like it? Gut smokin' righteous with one toke
You're psychic among knows possess you with one go
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future (that's right) is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
The essence, the basics without did you make it?
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't
That's a fallacy, I'm in them
Every sprouting tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise
Corruption in the skies (that's right)
From this fucking enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides
For me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind, that's the inner (fuck 'em)
So I'mma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
Feeling sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on, my future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on, my future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
My future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
My future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
My future`;
